After playing college football for the University of Michigan , Tom Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft . In Brady's 13 full seasons as a starter (he missed nearly all of 2008 with a torn ACL), [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the Patriots have earned six trips to the Super Bowl , winning four. Brady has won three Super Bowl MVP awards, two league MVP awards (2007, 2010), has been selected to ten Pro Bowls , and has led the Patriots to more division titles than any other quarterback in NFL history, with twelve. Brady is fifth on the all-time list for career passing yards and fifth for career touchdown passes . His career postseason record is 21 8; his playoff win total is the most in NFL history. He helped set the record for the longest consecutive win streak in NFL history with 21 straight wins over two seasons (2003 2004). He also set the record for most consecutive playoff wins with 10, and in 2007 led the Patriots to the first undefeated regular season since the institution of the 16-game schedule. He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any quarterback in NFL postseason history, and has the sixth highest career passer rating of all time (95.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing attempts. Tom Brady is considered among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. [ 6 ] He and Joe Montana are the only two players in NFL history to win the NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP awards multiple times. Brady is the only quarterback to lead his team to six Super Bowls, and holds the record for the most total Super Bowl touchdown passes. [ 7 ] He was named the NFL MVP in 2007 and 2010 (becoming the first player since 1986 to be unanimously chosen as MVP) as well as the 2007 Male Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press , the first NFL player to be so honored since 1990. After the 2010 season, Brady was ranked as the top player in the NFL Top 100 , a poll of league players. He also became the first quarterback to throw for 50 or more touchdowns in a season. In 2010, he set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358), [ 8 ] and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown to interception ratio, among players who have started a full season, at 9:1. Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful quarterback-coach tandem in NFL history, winning over 163 regular season games and 21 postseason games together, as well as appearing in six Super Bowls together, all NFL records.

[ 11 ] He was raised Catholic , and is of Irish descent on his father's side and of Polish, Norwegian, and Swedish descent on his mother's side. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Brady regularly attended 49ers games at Candlestick Park in the 1980s, where he became a fan of quarterback Joe Montana ; since then, Brady has mentioned Montana as one of his inspirations and an idol. [ 17 ] One of the games Brady attended was the 1981 NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys , in which Montana threw The Catch to Dwight Clark , with Brady only being four years old at the time. [ 18 ] Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo as a kid, where he learned to throw the football from camp counselor and quarterback Tony Graziani . [ 19 ] Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan. [ 20 ] Brady attended Jun pero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, graduating in 1995 at St. Mary's Cathedral . [ 21 ] While at Serra, Brady played football, basketball, and baseball. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady was drafted as a catcher in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos . [ 22 ] During the summer of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch . [ 23 ] In 2004, Brady was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. [ citation needed ] When Brady revisited two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, it was announced by school administration that the school had named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium. [ 24 ] College career Brady played college football for, and graduated from, the University of Michigan . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] He was a backup quarterback for his first two years, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship . When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart and had an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety and even considered transferring to California . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden , who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and maximize his performance on the field. [ 29 ] Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: \"\"He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't sure I could go.\" [ 30 ] Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson , [ 26 ] ultimately starting every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons under Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr . During his first full year as starter, he set Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season (214). [ 31 ] Brady was All-Big Ten honorable mention both seasons and team captain his senior year. The Wolverines won 20 of 25 games when he started, and he set a school record for completions in a 31-16 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten Conference title. Brady capped that season with a win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl . [ 32 ] In the 1999 season, Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two platooned over the season's first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started off 5-0, including a 26-22 win over Notre Dame and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin . Against Michigan State , Brady was not chosen to play the second half but was reinserted into the game with Michigan down 17; he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34-31. After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. Brady went on to lead Michigan to multiple 4th-quarter comebacks, including a remarkable 31-27 win against Penn State, and leading them out of a close game against Indiana, 34-31, heading into the regular season's final game, winners of three straight, earning him the moniker of \"Comeback Kid\". Brady concluded the regular season against Michigan's rival, Ohio State , in a dramatic game, with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17-17, Brady led Michigan to the winning score. He then led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama , throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns, leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14-0 in the first half, and 28-14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson . Michigan then won when Alabama missed an extra point following its own touchdown. Professional career Overview Brady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, and was selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of 2000 NFL draft . He has subsequently played his entire professional career with the Patriots and has enjoyed a distinguished and decorated career including four Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs and two League MVPs. Brady is considered among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. [ 6 ] In addition to his other accolades he has been named to the Pro Bowl ten times, and led the league in passing three times. He holds numerous NFL post-season passing records, and has more post-season wins than any other quarterback. With Brady playing quarterback, the Patriots have never had a losing season, have won 12 division titles, and played in a remarkable nine AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2014 (including four in a row from 2011 to 2014), winning six of them. Brady took over as the starting quarterback in his second season after an injury to Drew Bledsoe , and eventually led the Patriots to victory in Super Bowl XXXVI . The Patriots would miss the playoffs the following season, but would then win back-to-back titles in Brady's fourth and fifth years as a pro. Although Brady and Patriots continued to be highly successful, he did not return to the Super Bowl until the 2007 season . In that season Brady set an NFL record for touchdown passes, won his first League MVP, and led the Patriots to a 16-0 regular season record. However, the Patriots were upset by the New York Giants in spectacular fashion in Super Bowl XLII . Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a catastrophic knee injury in his first game. Brady won the NFL comeback player of the year in the 2009 season , and he and the Patriots continued in that and subsequent seasons to turn in strong performances, winning his second League MVP in 2010. However Brady did not return to the Super Bowl until the 2011 season where once again Brady and the Patriots were upset by the New York Giants. Brady then made his sixth and most recent trip to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (Brady's 15th as a pro) where Brady led a memorable fourth quarter comeback over the defending champion Seattle Seahawks for his fourth Super Bowl win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time. 2000 season Brady was selected with pick #199, a compensatory pick, in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft . [ 33 ] According to Michael Holley 's book Patriot Reign , the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay , both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein . [ 34 ] Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his later achievements, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Brady started the season as the fourth string quarterback, behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop ; by season's end , he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe. [ 39 ] During his rookie season, he was 1-of-3 passing, for six yards. [ 40 ] 2001 season The Patriots opened the season with a 23 17 loss at Cincinnati , with Bledsoe as the starting quarterback. [ 40 ] Their second game, and home opener, on September 23, was against their AFC East rival, the New York Jets . Bledsoe was again the starter, when in the fourth quarter he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis . Bledsoe returned for the next series, but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots' final series of the game. New York would hold on to win, 10 3, and the Patriots fell to 0 2 on the season. [ 41 ] Brady was named the starter for the season's third game, against the Indianapolis Colts . In his first two games as starter, Brady posted unspectacular passer ratings of 79.6 and 58.7, respectively, in a 44 13 victory over the Colts (in their last season in the AFC East) and a 30 10 loss to the Miami Dolphins . [ 42 ] In the Pats' fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26 16 in the fourth quarter, Brady led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal. Brady finished the game with 33 pass completions on 54 attempts, for 364 yards, and two touchdowns. [ 43 ] The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38 17 win. [ 44 ] The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East and entering the 2001 02 NFL playoffs with a first-round bye. Brady finished with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns and earned an invitation to the 2002 Pro Bowl . [ 40 ] [ 45 ] 2001 postseason In Brady's first playoff game , against the Oakland Raiders , he threw for 312 yards and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. A controversial play in that game came when, trailing by three in the fourth quarter, Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders' cornerback, and fellow Wolverine Charles Woodson . Oakland initially recovered the ball, but, citing the \" tuck rule ,\" which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay , ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble. [ 46 ] In the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers , Brady injured his knee, and was relieved by Bledsoe. [ 47 ] The Patriots won the game and were immediately instituted by Las Vegas oddsmakers as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI . [ 48 ] The score was tied with 1:21 left in the Super Bowl and the Patriots were at their own 17 with no timeouts when sportscaster and Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden said he thought the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime. [ 49 ] Instead, Brady drove the Patriots' offense down the field to the Rams 31 before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. The Patriots won the game by a score of 20 17, after Adam Vinatieri made another field goal as time expired. Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown , and no interceptions, becoming the then-youngest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl. [ 50 ] A possible quarterback controversy was averted when Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills in the offseason, cementing Brady's status as the starter. 2002 season Brady and the Patriots finished the year at 9 7, tied with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the division; however, the Jets won the division on the third tiebreaker, and the Patriots missed the playoffs. [ 51 ] Although posting a career-low single-season rating of 85.7, Brady threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes and 921 more yards than in 2001, though his fourteen interceptions would turn out to be a career high. [ 42 ] However, Brady played much of the second half of the season with a shoulder injury, and New England head coach Bill Belichick has since indicated that if the Patriots had made the playoffs, Brady would not have been able to play in the first game due to that injury. 2003 season In the 2003 NFL season , after a 2 2 start, Brady led the Patriots to twelve consecutive victories to finish the season, thus winning the AFC East. [ 52 ] Statistically, Brady's strongest game of the season was against Buffalo , when he achieved a season-high quarterback rating of 122.9. [ 42 ] Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns, [ 40 ] and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and Steve McNair . [ 53 ] 2003 postseason In the first two rounds of the playoffs , the Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts . On February 1, 2004, Brady led the Patriots to a 32 29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. During the game, Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a QB in a Super Bowl (32). With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 29 29, Brady engineered a drive to put the Patriots in position for the game-winning field goal. [ 54 ] 2004 season Brady during Super Bowl XXXIX During the 2004 season , Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21 straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (though for official records, the NFL considers it an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games). [ 55 ] New England's 14 2 record equalled that of their 2003 season, as well as tied the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion. [ 56 ] The Patriots also won the AFC East divisional title for the third time in four years. Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. [ 40 ] 2004 postseason In the AFC playoffs , Brady led the Patriots to victories over the Indianapolis Colts and the Pittsburgh Steelers . [ 57 ] Brady played his best game of the year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous treatment the previous night when he ran a temperature of 103 degrees. [ 58 ] Against the NFL's best defensive team, [ 57 ] he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season. [ 42 ] On February 6, 2005, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 24 21, to win Super Bowl XXXIX . Brady threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns [ 59 ] while capturing the Patriots' third championship in four years. 2005 season During the 2005 season , the Patriots were forced to rely more on Brady's passing, due to injuries suffered by running backs Corey Dillon , Patrick Pass , and Kevin Faulk . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Brady also had to adjust to a new center and a new running back: Heath Evans . The results were positive; Brady finished first in the league with 4,110 passing yards and third in the league with 26 touchdowns. [ 40 ] At 92.3, his 2005 passer rating was the second-highest of his career at the time, although he equalled his career high for interceptions with fourteen. [ 42 ] He rushed for 89 yards and fumbled a career-low four times. [ 42 ] He and the Patriots finished with a 10 6 record, winning their third straight AFC East title. [ 62 ] 2005 postseason In the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to a 28 3 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild card round; however, on January 14, 2006, the Patriots lost 27 13 to the Denver Broncos at INVESCO Field . Brady threw for 341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions, in the first playoff loss of his career. [ 63 ] After the season's end, it was revealed that Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since December. Linebacker Willie McGinest commented on it and said he knew, but Brady continued on playing. [ 64 ] Brady on the sideline with teammates Randy Moss and Jabar Gaffney , after throwing for his record-breaking 50th passing touchdown of the season at Giants Stadium . 2006 season Brady led the Patriots to a 12 4 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs. [ 65 ] In the regular season, Brady threw for 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns. [ 40 ] He was not among the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl, [ 66 ] although he was offered an injury-replacement selection when Philip Rivers was forced to withdraw (which he declined). [ 67 ] 2006 postseason In the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the New York Jets , in the wild-card round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37 16, as Brady went 22 34 for 212 yards and two TDs. [ 68 ] In the divisional round, the Patriots traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers . This was Brady's first playoff game in his home state of California. Brady and the Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI. [ 69 ] With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a key drive that would ultimately decide the game. After a 49-yard pass play to Reche Caldwell , a Stephen Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 24 21 win. [ 70 ] In the AFC championship, the Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts . The Patriots and Colts had faced each other twice in the previous three postseasons at Foxborough; this game, however, was played at Indianapolis. The Patriots led at halftime, 21 6; however, the Colts staged a comeback, culminating in a last minute interception thrown by Brady, and the Patriots losing the game to the Colts, 34 38. [ 71 ] 2007 season Playing with a dramatically overhauled receiver corps in the 2007 offseason , the Patriots acquired wide receivers Dont Stallworth , Wes Welker , Kelley Washington and Randy Moss ; tight end Kyle Brady ; and running back Sammy Morris Brady enjoyed what some sports writers have described as the best season ever by a quarterback. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The average score of a 2007 Patriots regular season game would be 37 17 by the end of the year. [ 74 ] Brady led the Patriots to the first 16 0 regular season record in league history, outscoring opponents by more than a 2-to-1 margin, but also attained numerous career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones in the process. While away at Dallas , he had a career-high five passing touchdowns in a 48 27 win . The win tied him with Roger Staubach for the most wins ever by a starting quarterback in his first 100 regular-season games, with 76. [ 75 ] The next week, in part of a 49 28 win at Miami, he had yet another record day, with six passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He also had the first perfect passer rating of his career. [ 76 ] Two weeks laters, as part of a come-from-behind 24 20 victory at Indianapolis , he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning 's NFL record of eight. [ 77 ] During the last game of the year, Brady threw two touchdown passes; his second touchdown was his 50th, breaking Peyton Manning's 2004 record of 49. [ citation needed ] Brady in December 2007 Brady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and only 8 interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was a then NFL record (it currently [ when? ] is the third best). He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is currently [ when? ] the fourth highest in a single season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is currently [ when? ] the third highest ever in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming the first team to ever go undefeated in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. Those records stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Broncos. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the Most Valuable Player of this season, as well as Offensive Player of the Year . He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year , the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990. [ 78 ] 2007 postseason In the Patriots' first playoff game, an AFC Divisional game against Jacksonville , Brady began the game with an NFL postseason record sixteen consecutive completed passes, and finished the game with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion rate of 92.9%. That mark is the highest single-game completion percentage (for passers with at least 20 attempts) in NFL history, regular season or postseason. [ 79 ] With the win, the Patriots matched the Dolphins as the only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season. Statistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against the San Diego Chargers, throwing three interceptions (including his first interception in the red zone since the playoff loss to Denver). Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21 12, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100 26 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana's. [ 80 ] In Super Bowl XLII , Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots did manage to take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to score a last-minute touchdown to upset the Patriots 17 14, taking away what would have been the first perfect season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games. Brady in action against the Washington Redskins on August 28, 2009. 2008 season Brady did not play in any games during the 2008 preseason or in the 2008 Pro Bowl due to two different foot injuries. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] In the Patriots' 2008 season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium , Brady's left knee was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard ; he left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed that Brady would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season. [ 83 ] Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament . [ 84 ] The injury ended Brady's streak of 111 consecutive starts (seventh in the list of most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback , behind Brett Favre , Peyton Manning , Ron Jaworski , and Joe Flacco ). [ 85 ] Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic October 6, using Brady's patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee. [ 86 ] An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] 2009 season Tom Brady in Landover, Maryland , on August 28, 2009, during warmups in a preseason game against the Washington Redskins . In his first game back from an injury, Brady threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns in the 2009 season opener against the Buffalo Bills . In the final minutes of the game, the Patriots were down 24 13 before Brady and Benjamin Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25 24 win. Brady was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 13th time in his career for his performance. [ 89 ] On October 18, 2009, in an early season snowstorm, Brady set an NFL record against the Tennessee Titans for most touchdowns in a single quarter, throwing five in the second quarter.

[ 90 ] The Patriots' 59 0 victory over the Titans tied the record for the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger , [ 91 ] and set a record for largest halftime lead in NFL history (they led 45 0). Brady would finish the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns for a 96.2 rating, [ 40 ] despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured ribs, all which were suffered over the course of the season. [ 92 ] He was selected as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of the Year . [ 93 ] 2009 postseason Brady ended the 2009 season throwing 3 interceptions in a Wild Card playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens , 33 14, his first career home playoff loss, and the first playoff loss at home by a New England Patriots quarterback since 1978.

[ 96 ] On November 21, 2010, Brady tied Brett Favre 's record of winning 25 consecutive regular-season home starts, in a 31 28 win over the Indianapolis Colts. [ 97 ] Brady's last regular-season loss at home was on November 12, 2006, a 17 14 loss to the New York Jets. [ 98 ] On December 6, 2010, Brady set an NFL record by winning 26 consecutive regular-season home starts, in a 45 3 victory over the New York Jets. [ 99 ] Brady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions on the season. [ 40 ] He had an 111.0 passer rating, giving him, at the time, two of the top five season ratings in NFL history, and making him the first player to finish with a rating above 110 in two different seasons. [ 100 ] Brady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl . However, he pulled out of the game (and was replaced by former backup Matt Cassel of the Kansas City Chiefs ) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot dating back to 2008. [ 101 ] Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year . He won, by unanimous decision, the MVP award for the second time in his career. [ 102 ] 2010 postseason After earning a bye week, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets in the divisional playoffs, 28-21.

[ 103 ] 2011 season In Week 1 of the 2011 NFL season , Brady threw for 517 yards and 4 touchdowns, with one interception, against the Miami Dolphins , the second time he had thrown for 400 or more yards in a single game . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] In the regular season finale against the Buffalo Bills , Brady became the fourth quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season, finishing with 5,235; it surpassed Dan Marino 's longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, but finished the season second behind Drew Brees ' 5,476. [ 40 ] 2011 postseason There's no quarterback I'd rather have than Tom Brady. He's the best. He does so much for us in so many ways on so many different levels. I'm very fortunate that he's our quarterback and what he's able to do for this team. It's good to win with him and all the rest of our players. If that's more than somebody else did, I don't really care about that. [ 106 ] Bill Belichick In the Patriots' 45 10 rout of the Denver Broncos in the Divisional round, Brady set a personal postseason best with 363 passing yards, and tied an NFL record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young , throwing for 6 touchdown passes. [ 107 ] The win, his first postseason win since January 2008, gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for postseason wins by a QB-coach combo with 15. [ 108 ] In the AFC Championship game against the Baltimore Ravens , Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 36 games, though he did pass for 239 yards and scored a 1-yard rushing touchdown late in the game. The Patriots were the beneficiaries of a missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff that saw the Brady and Patriots reach their fifth Super Bowl since Brady joined the team. [ 109 ] In Super Bowl XLVI , Brady and the Patriots met the New York Giants , meeting in the Championship for the second time in five years. Brady played well, leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first half and at one point completing 16 passes in the row for a 20/23 mark partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record. In all, he recorded two touchdowns, one interception, and was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone, leading to a crucial safety for the Giants. A final score of 21 17 for the Giants prevented Brady from winning his fourth Super Bowl. [ 110 ] 2012 season Brady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 NFL season and led the Patriots to a 12 4 record. The Patriot scored 557 total points, the third highest in league history and Brady became the first quarterback to lead his team to 10 division titles. With that point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads (another record). He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only 8 interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. It was Brady's third straight season throwing for over 30 touchdowns. [ 111 ] 2012 postseason Brady also started both Patriots play-off games , winning against the Houston Texans. With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff wins, with 17. The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl champ Baltimore Ravens , 28 13 in the AFC championship. On February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract extension, which will keep him with the team through 2017. [ 112 ] Peter King called it an \"amazing\" deal, as Brady took just $27 million in new money over the 2015, 2016, and 2017 seasons, and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert Kraft 's desire to make sure Brady retired a Patriot. [ 113 ] 2013 season Tom Brady and the New England Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski , the arrest of Aaron Hernandez , the departure of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd . To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce , and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins . Despite showing good chemistry with his new receiving corps in the preseason, Brady struggled in the first 2 games of the season completing only 52% of his passes (48 out of 91) and only 3 TD and one interception and passer rating under 75.0 in both games. Brady during the 2013 season In Weeks 3 and 4, Brady completed over 60% of his passes and threw 4 TDs and 1 interception in wins over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons. Brady, who was in pursuit of Drew Brees' record of at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive games , saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 loss against the Cincinnati Bengals that held him to 197 yards, completing under 50% of his passes (18 out of 38) for the second time in the season. In a Week 6 game against the New Orleans Saints, the Patriots struggled in the first half and bounced back in the second with Brady going 25 out of 43, for 269 yards and a clutch touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thompkins as time expired to pull out the upset over the Saints. The Patriots improved to 5 1 on the season. In Week 6 against the New York Jets, Brady was outplayed by Geno Smith, despite Rob Gronkowski coming back and having 8 catches for 114 yards. Brady completed 47.8% of his passes, marking the third time in the season he went under 50%. With Gronkowski healthy again, the Patriots had wins in Week 7 against divisional rival Miami Dolphins and Week 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Brady having his best game of the season going 23 out of 33, for 432 yards 4 TD and 0 interceptions, with a nearly perfect passer rating of 151.8 in a 55 31 win. Brady and the Patriots headed to the bye week with a 7 2 record. In a Week 10 loss to the Carolina Panthers, the Patriots trailed by 4 and Brady, with only 59 second left and three timeouts, drove his offense downfield to Carolina's 18 yard line, and with 3 seconds left, threw a pass to Rob Gronkowski that was intercepted despite the officials calling a defensive pass interference penalty on Luke Kuechly that was waved off. Brady and the 7 3 Patriots began in Week 11 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, in what was the 14th clash between the two, a series of three dramatic comeback wins. After going to the half trailing by 24, Brady and the Patriots scored 31 unanswered points. The Patriots won after a muffed punt in overtime with a field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. Brady outplayed Peyton Manning, who had been playing at an MVP level, throwing for 344 yards and 3 TDs as Peyton threw for 150 with 1 TD and an interception. After that, the Patriots began their Week 13 and Week 14 matchups trailing in the first half to then pull out comebacks in the 4th quarter. In the Week 15 AFC East clash against the Dolphins, the Patriots could have become, at least temporarily, the number 1 seed in the AFC as well as clinched the AFC East title for 5th season in a row, but this time the 4th quarter comeback was denied as Brady threw an interception as time expired on a potential game winning drive. Brady and the Patriots fell to 10 4. With a Week 16 win over the Baltimore Ravens, Brady collected his 147th win as a starting quarterback and tied Dan Marino for 4th place all time. With the Week 17 win over the Buffalo Bills, Tom Brady tied John Elway for the 3rd place all time in wins as a starting quarterback. 2013 postseason Brady's Patriots finished the season 12 4, to earn the second seed in the AFC and a first-round bye. In the Divisional Round matchup against the Indianapolis Colts , Brady made his 25th playoff appearance, breaking Brett Favre 's career record for playoff appearances by a quarterback (Jerry Rice appeared in 29 playoff games). The following week, the Patriots lost to the Denver Broncos, eliminating Brady and the Patriots from the playoffs. 2014 season Brady in September 2014 vs. the Vikings.

Against the Oakland Raiders Brady was pressured all day, but threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in 16-9 win. After a 41-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs , Brady led New England to back-to-back wins, including his first 300-yard performance of the season, against the Buffalo Bills . Brady then defeated the New York Jets with a 261-yard performance that included 3 touchdowns. The following week, a 51-23 embarrassment of the Chicago Bears saw Brady throw for 354 yards and a season-high 5 touchdowns. After passing for 333 yards, and 257 yards in his next two games against the Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts respectively, Brady defeated the Detroit Lions 34-9 with 349 passing yards and 2 touchdowns against only one interception. The Patriots winning streak was put to the test against the Green Bay Packers in week 13. Down 13-0 early, Brady threw for 2 touchdowns, no picks, and 245 yards. Still down 26-21, Brady was unable to give the Patriots their 8th straight victory. After trailing 14-3 at the San Diego Chargers , Brady rallied his team with 317 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and only one pick, to a 23-14 comeback win. Brady clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with 287 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and a pick. Brady struggled in his final two games, throwing for only 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in 17-16 victory against the Jets, and 80 yards in one half of a game against the Buffalo Bills , a 17-9 loss. 2014 postseason In a 35-31 Divisional Round win over the Ravens , Brady threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth, breaking Curtis Martin 's club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs; Brady also broke Joe Montana 's record for playoff touchdowns with 46. After the Ravens scored on their first two possessions, the Patriots were quickly down 14-0. Brady led New England on an 8 play, 78 yard drive, and ran for a score to cut the Raven lead to 14-7. In the second quarter, Brady's 15 yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola tied the score at 14-14. After getting the ball back, Brady threw an interception at the end of the first half. Joe Flacco capitalized on it by throwing an 11-yard touchdown strike to Owen Daniels to give Baltimore a 21-14 halftime lead. Down 28-14, Brady engineered an 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown to Rob Gronkowski to cut the lead to 28-21. With the score tied at 28, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker drilled a 25-yard field goal to give Baltimore a 31-28 4th quarter lead. Brady got the ball back, and threw a 23-yard touchdown to Brandon LaFell to give the Patriots their first lead, up 35-31. After a Duron Harmon interception and a Joe Flacco Hail Mary attempt failed, Brady clinched his record 9th AFC Championship Game , fourth straight, and the third championship game against the Indianapolis Colts . After a 45-7 blowout, Brady advanced to play his record breaking sixth Super Bowl, breaking a tie with John Elway . In Super Bowl XLIX , Brady completed 37-50 passes for 328 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. He guided a 10-point 4th quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring , tying him with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a starting quarterback. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana's record for most Super Bowl MVP's. His 37 complete passes in the game is a Super Bowl record. [ 114 ] Deflategate Further information: Deflategate On May 6, 2015, the NFL published a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs used in the AFC Championship game. [ 115 ] The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on \"substantial and credible evidence\" that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed to cooperate with investigators. [ 116 ] NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Troy Vincent 's May 11 letter to Brady stated in part: \"Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football.\" [ 117 ] Troy Vincent's letter further stated: \"With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence.\" [ 117 ] Brady, through the NFL Players Association , officially appealed the suspension on May 14. [ 118 ] On July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld Brady's suspension. [ 119 ] Brady has reportedly given permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court. [ 120 ] On July 28, the NFL announced the upholding of the four-game suspension, citing Brady's destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor: \"On or shortly before March 6, the day that Tom Brady met with independent investigator Ted Wells and his colleagues, Brady directed that the cell phone he had used for the prior four months be destroyed,\" the league statement read. \"He did so even though he was aware that the investigators had requested access to text messages and other electronic information that had been stored on that phone. During the four months that the cell phone was in use, Brady had exchanged nearly 10,000 text messages, none of which can now be retrieved from that device. The destruction of the cell phone was not disclosed until June 18, almost four months after the investigators had first sought electronic information from Brady.\" [ 121 ] [ 122 ] The NFL also filed papers in Manhattan federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell's decision. [ 123 ] On July 29 Brady released a statement on his Facebook page criticizing Goodell's decsion to uphold the suspension, saying in part \"I am very disappointed by the NFL's decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. I did nothing wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either... I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight.\" [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Commentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report referred to the penalties as \"brutal\". [ 126 ] Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Others described the punishment as \"firm but fair\". [ 128 ] Brady's suspension was overturned by Judge Richard M. Berman on September 3, 2015, allowing him to play in the first four games of the 2015 season. [ 129 ] 2015 season Brady returned for the preseason opener against the Packers, but he completed only one pass for 10 yards in the first quarter, leaving backup Jimmy Garoppolo to play the rest of the game. Brady led the Patriots to a 28-21 win over the Steelers on Week 1. He threw for 288 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski. The win gave Brady the 161st of his career, surpassing the record held by Brett Favre for most wins by a quarterback with a single team. In week 2, Brady followed his performance up by throwing for 466 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Bills. Through the first five games of the season, Brady has thrown 14 touchdowns with 1 interception and a quarterback rating of 118.4.

A five-time league MVP , he played for the Indianapolis Colts for 14 seasons between 1998 and 2011. He is a son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and an elder brother of New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning . Manning played college football for the University of Tennessee , leading the Volunteers to the 1997 SEC Championship in his senior season. However, No. 3 Tennessee lost to the No. 2 Nebraska Cornhuskers 42 17 in the Orange Bowl , giving Nebraska and Tom Osborne their 3rd national championship in 4 years. He was chosen by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft . Manning's playing career and statistics have ranked him among the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. From 1998 to 2010, he led the Colts to eight (seven AFC South and one AFC East ) division championships, three AFC championships, and one Super Bowl championship ( Super Bowl XLI ). His five NFL MVPs are a league record, [ 2 ] he was the most valuable player of Super Bowl XLI, has been named to 14 Pro Bowls , has thirteen 4,000-yard passing seasons, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and is the Indianapolis Colts' all-time leader in passing yards (54,828) and touchdown passes (399). In 2009, he was named the best player in the NFL, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and Fox Sports , along with Sports Illustrated , named him the NFL player of the decade for the 2000s. Before the 2013 season had even finished, SI had named him their Sportsman of the Year. [ 5 ] In May 2011, he underwent neck surgery to alleviate neck pain and arm weakness he dealt with during the previous few seasons before signing a five-year, $90 million contract extension with the Colts in July 2011. Manning had hoped to play in the 2011 season, but in September 2011 he underwent a second, and much more serious surgery: a level-one cervical fusion procedure. Manning had never missed an NFL game in his career, but was forced to miss the entire 2011 season. He was released by the Colts on March 7, 2012, and after an almost two-week period where he visited with and worked out for several NFL teams, he signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20, 2012. On October 19, 2014, he broke Brett Favre 's record for most career TDs when he threw his 509th touchdown pass, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. Manning's pre-snap routine has earned him the nickname \"The Sheriff\", and he is one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL. Teams led by Manning more often than not use the hurry-up offense in place of the standard huddle .

He led his team to a 34 5 record during three seasons as starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. [ 6 ] While at Newman he began wearing the number 18 in honor of his older brother Cooper , who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis . Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the number 18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym. [ 7 ] College career Manning surprised many when he chose to attend the University of Tennessee and play for the Tennessee Volunteers football team, instead of attending the University of Mississippi , his father's alma mater . [ 8 ] He became Tennessee's all-time leading passer with 11,201yards and 89touchdowns and won 39 of 45 games as a starter, breaking the Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for career wins. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Manning's number was retired by the University of Tennessee in 2005 As a freshman , Manning was the third-string quarterback, but injuries to Todd Helton and Jerry Colquitt forced him to take over the Mississippi State game, a 24 21 loss. In his first start, the following week against Washington State , the Vols won, 10 9, and the Vols won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8 4 with a 45 23 victory over Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Manning and the Vols started off the 1995 season with victories over East Carolina and Georgia, before heading off to Gainesville to play the Gators . [ 14 ] Against Florida, he threw for 326yards and 2touchdowns, leading the Vols to a 30 21 halftime lead. However, the Gators outscored the Vols 41 7 in the second half, winning 62 37. [ 15 ] This was the Vols' only loss of the season, as they won their remaining 8 regular season games, including a 41 14 win over Alabama and then defeated Ohio State in the Citrus Bowl . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The Vols ended the season ranked third and Manning came in sixth in Heisman Trophy voting. [ 18 ] The Vols opened the 1996 season ranked second behind Nebraska and one of the favorites to win the national championship. [ 19 ] However, after winning their first 2 games against UNLV and UCLA , the Vols again lost to Florida 35 29, with Manning throwing 4 interceptions. [ 20 ] After winning their next four games, the Vols were upset by Memphis , despite Manning passing for 296yards. [ 21 ] The Vols won the remainder of their games, including a 48 28 win in the Citrus Bowl over Northwestern , a game in which Manning passed for 408yards and 4touchdowns; he was named the game's MVP . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Manning completed his degree in three years, a Bachelor of Arts in speech communication, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] and was projected to be the top overall pick in the NFL Draft , but returned to Tennessee for his senior year. [ 26 ] In his senior season , the Vols opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA, but for the third time in his career, Manning fell to Florida 33 20. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10 1, and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn . Down 20 7, Manning led the Vols to a 30 29 victory. Throwing for 4touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The 3rd-ranked Vols were matched-up with second-ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl ; if Tennessee won and top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl , the Vols would win the national championship. [ 32 ] However, the Vols' defense could not stop Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up over 400rushing yards in a 42 17 loss. [ 33 ] As a senior, Manning won numerous awards; he was a consensus first-team All-American , the Maxwell Award winner, the Davey O'Brien Award winner, the Johnny Unitas Award winner, and the Best College Player ESPY award winner, among others; however, he did not win the Heisman, finishing runner-up to Charles Woodson . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In 2005, Tennessee retired Manning's number (No. 16). [ 37 ] One of the streets leading to Neyland Stadium has been renamed Peyton Manning Pass. Manning also excelled academically and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1997 [ 24 ] and awarded the National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award. [ 38 ] Professional career Overview Peyton Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick of the 1998 NFL draft . He would start as a rookie go on to play for the Colts for 13 full seasons before being sidelined by a neck injury, which cost him the entire 2011 season . After recovering from the injury he joined the Denver Broncos for whom he has played since the 2012 season . Excluding the year lost to injury, Manning is now playing in his 17th NFL season. Manning has had an extremely successful career, and is frequently referred to as one of the greatest passing quarterbacks of all time. [ 39 ] He has been named the NFL's most valuable player a record five times (four times as a Colt, once as a Bronco), has been named to the Pro Bowl 14 times (a record) and named first team All-Pro seven times. As a starter up to the end of 2014 season he had a career winning percentage of .699 in the regular season. He holds the NFL record for career touchdown passes, and barring injury seems likely to overtake Brett Favre 's career passing yardage record during the 2015 season . The most commonly cited criticism of Peyton Manning's professional career is that despite great success and gaudy statistics during the regular season, he has not enjoyed similar levels of success in the post-season. Although Manning has won one Super Bowl ( Super Bowl XLI , in which he was named MVP) and played in two others, his career post-season record as a starter is a more modest 9-10. Although by no means unsuccessful, by comparison his regular season record prior to the start of the 2015 season was 179-77. Indianapolis Colts 1998 season: rookie season \"To me, he's the greatest of all time. He's a friend of mine, and someone that I always watch and admire, because he always wants to improve, he always wants to get better, and he doesn't settle for anything less than the best. So, when you watch the best and you're able to learn from the best, hopefully that helps me get better.\" Tom Brady , on Peyton Manning. [ 40 ] Despite concerns about his arm strength and mobility, [ 41 ] Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 draft by the Indianapolis Colts . [ 42 ] Although many considered Ryan Leaf his rival for the first selection in the draft, and Leaf's quarterback rating was higher, all six experts Sports Illustrated consulted believed that Manning was superior. Five said that they would take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said of Manning, \"this is a pro quarterback\". [ 43 ] In his rookie season , he passed for 3,739yards with 26touchdowns, set five different NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season, and was named to the NFL All-Rookie First Team. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Manning's first win came against fellow rookie Leaf, 17 12 over the Chargers . [ 47 ] Weeks later, Manning faced off against Steve Young ; he threw threetouchdowns, tying a Colts rookie record, but the 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34 31. [ 48 ] In November against the Jets , Manning threw for threetouchdowns in a 24 23 win; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. It was the first game-winning drive of Manning's career, as he hit Marcus Pollard with the game-winning TD pass. [ 45 ] [ 49 ] Manning was certainly a bright spot in 1998 for the Colts , but he also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3 13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game. The Colts lost many close games, including five games in which they had led by double-digits at some point. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] 1999 2001 The Colts opened the 1999 season with a 31 14 victory over Buffalo , but gave up a 28 7 lead the following week against the Patriots and lost. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] After defeating San Diego 27 19 in a game in which Manning threw for over 400yards, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week, they lost again, to Miami . [ 45 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] The Colts responded by winning 11 of their remaining 12 games, finishing 13 3 and the AFC East champions. The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. [ 56 ] As the second seed in the AFC, the Colts earned a first round bye, and faced Tennessee in the playoffs . The Colts lost 19 16 to the Super Bowl bound Titans and Manning was limited to one touchdown run. [ 57 ] Manning finished the year with 4,135 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns, and was named both Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl , both firsts for him. [ 44 ] [ 58 ] In the Pro Bowl , he passed for 270yards with 2touchdowns. [ 59 ] The Colts started the 2000 season inconsistently. Following an opening week victory against Kansas City , they blew a 21 0 lead against the Raiders . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The Colts responded with a Monday Night victory against Jacksonville , a 43 14 win in which Manning threw for 430yards and 4touchdowns; Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. [ 45 ] [ 62 ] The Colts won 4 of their next 5 games, including one against New England in which Manning posted the first perfect passer rating of his career, but then lost 4 of the 5 games following that. The Colts regained their momentum, winning their final 3 games, including a 31 10 win over Minnesota on Week 17. Manning threw for 4 touchdowns in the win and was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week and the win gave the Colts a 10 6 record as well as a wild card spot in the playoffs. [ 45 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] In the wild card game, the Colts fell to the Dolphins 23 17 in overtime. Manning passed for 194 yards and a touchdown in the loss. [ 65 ] He finished the season with 4,413 passing yards and 33 passing touchdowns and was named Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl. [ 44 ] At the Pro Bowl , Manning threw two touchdown passes. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Manning and the Colts introduced their now-signature no-huddle offense, and used it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets , 45 24. [ 68 ] Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks ) the Colts advanced to 2 0 with a win over Buffalo , behind Manning's 421yards passing. [ 69 ] He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. [ 45 ] However, the Colts lost the following week to New England , and continued their slide, losing their following two games. [ 70 ] The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40 21 home loss to the 49ers . [ 71 ] After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous \"Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are you kidding me. Playoffs? I'm just hoping we can win a game, another game\" press conference. [ 72 ] Despite the 6 10 record, Manning finished the season with 4,131 passing yards , 26 passing touchdowns , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season. [ 44 ] 2002 season Tony Dungy would become Manning's second head coach in the NFL. The Colts started off the 2002 season 4 1, before a 3-game losing streak sent them to 4 4. The Colts responded by winning all but two of their remaining games, including a 35 13 upset of the Eagles in which Manning had a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career, giving them a 10 6 record and a spot in the playoffs.

[ 45 ] On Monday Night Football against the defending champion Buccaneers, Manning and the Colts trailed 35 14 in the final five minutes. After one short TD drive, the Colts recovered the onside kick. Manning threw a 28-yard TD pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th & 6 to make it 35 28. With 1:41 remaining, Manning got the ball back and drove the offense 85 yards for the game-tying TD. He set up the winning 29-yard field goal in overtime for a stunning 38 35 win. It was the only time in NFL history a team won a game after trailing by 21 points in the final 4 minutes of regulation. Manning passed for 386 yards in the game. [ 76 ] After an overtime loss to Carolina , the Colts won all but three of their remaining games, finishing 12 4. [ 77 ] On November 30 the Colts hosted the 9 2 Patriots in what would be the beginning of the NFL's top rivalry of the 2000s. The Colts trailed 31 10 late in the third quarter before Manning threw three TD passes in a span of six minutes to tie the game. Trailing 38 34 in the final minutes, the Colts had 3 plays at the 1-yard line to try and score the winning TD. Edgerrin James was stuffed on 4th down by Willie McGinest and the Patriots won.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] In the Wild Card game against Denver, Manning passed for 458yards and 4touchdowns. [ 99 ] However, the Colts' 2004 season ended in Foxborough for a second straight year with a 20 3 loss against New England, when Manning recorded a season-low passer rating of 69.3. It was Manning's seventh consecutive loss to the Patriots in Foxborough and the Colts' three points were their lowest single game point total since their opening game of the 2003 season. [ 100 ] Manning was named a Pro Bowl starter; in the Pro Bowl , he threw 3touchdowns in a 38 27 victory and was named the game's MVP. [ 101 ] Manning was also a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection. [ 102 ] 2005 season Manning at the 2006 Pro Bowl In 2005 , the Colts had a greatly improved defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40 21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl Champions, New England.

[ 45 ] [ 103 ] By week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13 0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, Tony Dungy made the decision to play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26 17. [ 104 ] Manning finished the season with 3,747 passing yards , the first time he had thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season of 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season. [ 44 ] In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers visited the RCA Dome for the second AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the 4th quarter with only a few minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending interception to Troy Polamalu , but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). [ 105 ] The Colts went on to score, and were able to get the ball back down three points near the end of the game. On 4th down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger managed to dive in front of Harper and tackle him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out. [ 106 ] Manning came in second in voting for the MVP award to Shaun Alexander ending his streak at two years. [ 107 ] He was named the 2005 winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award and nominated for the FedEx Air Player of the Year Award, along with Tom Brady and Carson Palmer .

It was the first NFL game with starting quarterbacks that were brothers, and Peyton's team won 26 21. [ 111 ] Manning passed for 400 yards against the Texans in a 43 24 victory, which earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors (he also won the award for his 345 yards and 4 TD passes against the Redskins in week 7). A second trip to New York, this time to play the Jets, produced another Colts win. After taking the lead twice in the fourth quarter, Manning had to lead a third scoring drive, this time finishing with a 1-yard QB sneak rushing TD in the last minute for a 31 28 win. [ 112 ] At Denver, Manning again led three scoring drives in the fourth quarter in a 34 31 shootout win. He completed 32 of 39 passes for 345 yards and 3 TDs.

However, Brady led the Patriots to two late touchdowns, to hand Manning his first loss of the season, 24 20. Manning finished the game with 225yards passing, including a passing touchdown. He also had a rushing touchdown. [ 125 ] Manning did not bounce back from the loss well. Against the San Diego Chargers he threw for a career-worst and franchise-record 6 interceptions. Despite this, he was able to rally the Colts from a 23 0 deficit to 23 21, and gave Adam Vinatieri an opportunity to take the lead with a 29-yard field goal. Vinatieri's miss sunk the Colts to 7 2. Manning did not play particularly well against the Kansas City Chiefs either, throwing no touchdowns.

[ 200 ] Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLVIX), but the record-setting offense didn't record a first down until the 2nd quarter, and didn't put points on the board until the final seconds of the 3rd quarter. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage set the tone for the game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early. The ball sailed past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved too much for the Broncos to overcome.
